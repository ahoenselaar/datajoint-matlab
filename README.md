DataJoint for MATLAB is a high-level programming interface to MySQL databases. It was designed by Dimitri Yatsenko in [Andreas Tolias' Lab](toliaslab.org) for the distributed processing and management of large volumes of data in a science lab. DataJoint is built on the foundation of the relational data model and prescribes a consistent method for organizing, populating, and querying data.

The complete documentation is provided on the [wiki pages](https://github.com/dimitri-yatsenko/datajoint-matlab/wiki).

This branch supports Matlab versions 2009a-R2010a, which is necessary to make it compatible wth 32-bit libraries on MacOS X (e.g. PsychToolbox).
